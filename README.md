## MTR-Viewer: identifying regions within genes under purifying selection
In 2019 a reasherche has been conducted by Silk M, Petrovski S and Ascher DB to find the regions within genes under purifying selection [[1]](#1)
Considering the Reaserche that has been done by Silk M, Petrovski S and Ascher DB and published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research,
