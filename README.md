# MIRs_In_IDRs
Here in this Repository it is intended to find if there is any correlation Between Missense Intolerant Region with Intrinsically Disordered Region Using MTR Dataset.

## Introduction
With the recent technological advancments now exome sequencing is becoming a routine tool to guide personalized medicine of genetic diseases [[1,2]](#1,#2)

## MTR-Viewer: identifying regions within genes under purifying selection
In 2019 a research has been conducted by Silk M, Petrovski S and Ascher DB to find the regions within genes under purifying selection [[3]](#3). This research has been published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research.

In this work they have presented a measure of regional intolerance to missense variation calculated using variation from 240 000 exome and genome sequences. 

The Results are published in 2 versions:

Version 1 calculated across the Ensembl v75 transcript set and cross gnomAD only.

Version 2 calculated across the Ensembl v95 transcript set and across over 220,000 exomes using gnomAD, Biobank UK and DiscovEHR.

You Can find the Download link to either of these Versions [here](https://biosig.lab.uq.edu.au/mtr-viewer/downloads).

**It is needless to say that we are using The second version data for this study.**
